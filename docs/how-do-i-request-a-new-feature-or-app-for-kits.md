In 2018, Learning Innovation introduced Duke to a beta version of Kits. Kits is a strategic partnership between Duke Learning Innovation and the Office of Information Technology to build a next generation digital learning environment (NGDLE).

Learning technologies across higher education have traditionally focused on meeting faculty’s teaching needs through the Learning Management System (LMS). With Kits, we are designing for a more pluralistic and diverse ecosystem of technologies that support more specific learning experiences. We aim to give faculty, staff and students scalable, excellent, and integrated choices, not a single, forced enterprise “solution.” Our premise: learning happens best when appropriate tech is paired with evidence-based pedagogy.

We’re developing Kits in the open and sharing our progress on [GitHub] (https://github.com/DukeLearningInnovation/kits).
