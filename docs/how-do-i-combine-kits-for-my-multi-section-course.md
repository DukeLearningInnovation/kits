## How do I combine kits for my multi-section course?<br>

Instructors who are teaching a course with multiple sections often need to set up a learning app that is shared with all sections.  The **Combine Kits** feature in Kits allows instructors to associate multiple course sections together..  **All learning apps added to the Combined Kit will be automatically shared with all sections in the kit.**

To create a combined kit, **click the Create Kit button** in the lower-right-hand corner of the screen then **click Create Combined kit**.

On the next screen, you will be prompted to select the kits you would like to combine.  Start by **searching for the name of the course** you would like to combine to filter results only to that course.  Next, click the **check mark next to the name of the kits** you would like to combine.  *You may need to navigate through multiple pages to select all kits.*

When you have finished selecting all kits to combine **click the Add Kits button**.

After clicking the Add Kits button, you will then see the kits you selected to combine at the top of the screen.  **To remove a kit, click the blue X in the Remove column**.  To add more kits, see the Select Kits option below.  When your combined kit list is complete, **click the Confirm Kits button**.

You should now see your combined kit under the **Combined Kit category** in Kits.

This stacked view of your combined kit is an **instructor view** and allows the instructor to add apps to the combined kit to be **shared with all course rosters in the combined kit**.  When students login to Kits, they see a kit for the lecture section and the lab section that they are enrolled in with all apps added by the instructor.

To see all kits in the combined kit, **click the three vertical dots menu** (kebab menu) in the upper right corner of the kit.  Then click **View/Edit Kit** in the menu.

The kits included in the combined kit will be listed.  Apps may also be added to a single kit within the combined kit.  These apps will be shared only with the students and members of the individual kit.
