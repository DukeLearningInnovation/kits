## How can non-Duke users access my kit?<br>

Guest accounts for non-Duke users can be set up through [OneLink](https://accounts.oit.duke.edu/onelink/about) or [Sponsored Accounts](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/sponsored-accounts).

The Kits application **is not** accessible to OneLink users.  If you intend to use Kits as a central point of access for external Duke members, [request a sponsored account](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/sponsored-accounts) for these members instead of relying on OneLink.

Only two applications in the Kits App store are **accessible by OneLink users** - *Sakai and WordPress*.

The following applications **allow sharing by link**: *Box, Confluence (Duke Wiki), Warpwire, and Zoom*.

For **more restrictive sharing** of apps, see the guide below.
