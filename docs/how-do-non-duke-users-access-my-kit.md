## How do non-Duke users access my kit?<br>

The Kits application **is not** accessible to OneLink users.  If you intend to use Kits as a central point of access for external Duke members, [request a sponsored account](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/sponsored-accounts) for these members instead of relying on OneLink.
