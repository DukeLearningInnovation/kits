## How do I select the right role for kit members?<br>

There are two types of kits and each have their own roles: course and collaboration.

Course kits have the roles of Instructor, Assistant, Student, and Visitor.

Collaboration kits have the roles of Owner, Editor, Viewer, and Visitor.

**_Note:_** *Course kits that are official Duke courses are shared with students in the course roster automatically. The appropriate roles are given to instructor and student roster participants by default.*

Roles in Kits have their own permissions for the Kits application and **may be different than the permissions for roles of the same name in an app you add to your kit**.  Here are the permissions for roles in the Kits application:

### Course kits <br>

**Instructor:**
**Assistant:**
**Student:**
**Visitor:**

### Collaboration kits <br>

**Owner:**
**Editor:**
**Viewer:**
**Visitor:**

Apps added to your kit have their own roles and permissions independent of your kit.  Not all roles in all apps are available as a role in your kit.  Here are the mappings between kits roles and apps integrated with Kits.
