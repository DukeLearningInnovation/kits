## How do I select the right role for kit members?<br>

There are two types of kits, course and collaboration, and each have their own roles.

**Course kits** have the roles of *Instructor, Assistant, Student, and Visitor.*

**Collaboration kits** have the roles of *Owner, Editor, Viewer, and Visitor.*

**_Note:_** *Course kits that are official Duke courses are shared with students in the course roster automatically. The appropriate roles are given to instructor, assistant, and student roster participants by default.*

Roles in Kits have their own permissions for the Kits application and **may be different than the permissions for roles of the same name in an app you add to your kit**.  <br><br>Here are the permissions for roles in the Kits application:

### Course kits<br>

**Instructor:** Instructors in course kits can add, edit, and remove members and apps. They can also delete a course kit that is not associated with an official Duke course.  *Official roster members are managed by DukeHub.*

**Assistant:** Assistants in course kits can add, edit, and remove members and apps.  *Official roster members are managed by DukeHub.*

**Student:** Students in course kits can view kit members and access kit apps. They can also use the Custom Link tool to add their own learning resources visible only to the individual student.

**Visitor:** Vistors in course kits can access apps in a kit.  They cannot see kit members, nor can they add, edit, or remove apps.

### Collaboration kits<br>

**Owner:** Owners in collaboration kits can add, edit, and remove members and apps. They can also delete the kit.

**Editor:** Editors in collaboration kits can add, edit, and remove members and apps. They cannot delete the kit.

**Viewer:** Viewers in collaboration kits can view kit members and access kit apps. They have no editing permissions.

**Visitor:**  Visitors in collaboration kits can only access kit apps.

**Apps added to your kit have their own roles and permissions independent of your kit.**  Not all roles in all apps are available as a role in your kit.  <br><br> Here are the **mappings between kits roles and apps** integrated with Kits.
